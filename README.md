# PomodoroTimer

My first attempt into understanding Javascript. I followed the tutorial here, but tweak it to my own taste. The original work allows user to put in variable input for the work and break session, currently my code does not allow for that. Next steps to put an input field to listen for new input in the work/break sessions.
